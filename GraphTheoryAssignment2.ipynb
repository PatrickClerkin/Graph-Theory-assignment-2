    "Conclusion and Method Comparison:\n",
    "\n",
    "After testing all methods on our graph pairs, we can make several observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Method 3 (Exhaustive Permutation Matrix Approach) is generally the worst performer:\n",
    "   - It has to check all n! permutations, which quickly becomes computationally inefficient\n",
    "   - For graphs with just 10 vertices, we'd need to check 3628800 permutations\n",
    "   - The time complexity is O(n! × n²) where n is the number of vertices\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Method 2 (Edge Translation) performs quite well when used with the candidate mappings \n",
    "   from Method 1:\n",
    "   - Verifying each mapping has O(n²) complexity for checking all edges\n",
    "   - When combined with the refined candidate list from Method 1, this is very efficient\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Method 4 (Optimized Approach) is generally the best performer:\n",
    "   - It uses structural properties to drastically reduce the search space\n",
    "   - The permutation matrix calculation serves as a clean mathematical verification\n",
    "   - The time complexity depends on the number of candidate mappings, which is typically\n",
    "     much smaller than n!\n",
    "\n",
    "All three methods (2, 3, and 4) produce the same results when the graphs are isomorphic, \n",
    "confirming that they are all valid approaches to the graph isomorphism problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The major efficiency gain comes from Method 1's ability to group vertices by their\n",
    "structural properties, which is particularly effective for sparse graphs or graphs \n",
    "with distinguishable vertex properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimized approach can handle moderately sized graphs efficiently,\n",
    "but would still struggle with large, highly regular graphs where structural properties \n",
    "don't provide much discrimination between vertices.\n",
